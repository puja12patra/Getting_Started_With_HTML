    <h3>About HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page, and
        consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. <br> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
        objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
        quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </p>

    <h3>About CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS is a language that describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS
        saves a lot of work, because it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.CSS is designed to
        enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br> This separation can
        improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
        file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached
        to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

    <h3>About Javascript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class
        functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments
        also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.</p>
